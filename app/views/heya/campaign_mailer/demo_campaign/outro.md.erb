Whew<%= @user.first_name.present? ? ", #{@user.first_name}" : nil %>, we made it!

Is Heya right for you? If so, can you do me three favors?

1. Star it on GitHub: https://github.com/honeybadger-io/heya
2. Tell your friends and colleagues about it, tweet about it, etc. The more interest there is in it, the more time I can justify putting into making it better.
3. Use it in your Rails apps!

If not, no worries; itâ€™s not for everyone. Speaking of, if you would rather not get further emails about Heya, click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of this email before you go. I may send an occasional followup to those who wish to remain on this list.

Thanks<%= @user.first_name.present? ? " #{@user.first_name}" : nil %>!!
