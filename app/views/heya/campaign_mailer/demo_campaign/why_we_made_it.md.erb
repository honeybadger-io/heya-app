Hi <%= @user.first_name.presence || "there" %>,

As the digital world grows more complex, marketing isn't getting easier. New SaaS-based Martech (Marketing Technology) products are launching left and right--so many that there's a whole category dedicated to just glueing them together (think Segment, Zapier, etc.).

In response, governments are constantly rolling out new privacy regulations, requiring businesses to comply with stricter rules governing user data.

**It's a mess for a reason: the whole system is a dumpster fire.**

If you're a fortune 1000 company, you're probably stuck with the status quo... but what about the rest of us? Do we really NEED all of this?

At Honeybadger (a developer-run SaaS), we realized that we don't--we just need a few well-made tools. In the next email, weâ€™ll discuss how Heya fits this bill.
