Hey <%= @user.first_name.presence || "there" %>,

Imagine onboarding and engaging your users with full access to their data, without maintaining a single 3rd-party integration or stressing over compliance. That's Heya: a new way to email your users.

Heya lives inside your Rails app, giving you full access to your customer data with the power of Ruby and Rails for building automated email campaigns.

If you've ever used 3rd-party email or marketing platforms, you've felt the pain of integrating, syncing customer data, and maintaining complex logic and rules--all of which is unnecessary in Heya.

Email automation becomes startlingly simple when your application framework *is* your automation tool.

In the next email, I'll talk about why we made Heya.
