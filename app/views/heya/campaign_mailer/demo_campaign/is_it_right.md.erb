Hey <%= @user.first_name.presence || "there" %>,

We get it. Some large companies *need* complex marketing stacks that let their marketing teams test all the latest products and tools as soon as they launch... but is that you?

**Some of us just need to send some emails.**

As Rails developers who run a customer-focused SaaS business, we wanted a way to communicate with our users without using a complicated 3rd-party tool like Intercom or Drip. It had to be self-hosted, easy to set up and use, and as reliable as the hosted alternatives.

Heya is all of these things and more. Its become much more than a cheaper alternative to the hosted services: it beats them in a lot of ways.

In the next email I'll tell you how. Stay tuned.
