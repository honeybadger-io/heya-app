Hi <%= @user.first_name.presence || "there" %>,

Thanks for checking out Heya!

This is the first of a 7-email sequence designed to teach you about Heya while seeing what it is and how it works.

**What is Heya?** In plain english: *it's a Rails engine that makes it easy to send a series of emails to the people in your user database.*

In the next email, I'll explain why Heya is better than using a 3rd party service for this sort of thing.
