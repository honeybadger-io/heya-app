Hey <%= @user.first_name.presence || "there" %>,

Heya is super easy to set up and it simplifies automation, but that's not all it can do.

If you've ever tried some of the more advanced techniques such as coordinating multiple campaigns or using automated workflows in 3rd-party marketing systems, you know how difficult it is to design and troubleshoot. "Baling wire and duct tape" does not do it justice.

Heya takes a different approach. Want to send someone three campaigns, but make sure they never get two emails at the same time? That's easy because **Heya coordinates campaigns by default**; it will never send someone multiple campaigns at the same time, unless you explicitly tell it to.

Instead, Heya lets you *prioritize* campaigns so that the most important campaign is always sent first, while the less important campaigns wait their turn.

Oh yeah, and remember the slow anxiety you feel when you finish a long workflow and realize that *you have no way to test it?* You can fully unit test Heya, because in the end, it's just Rails. How's that for the icing on the cake?
