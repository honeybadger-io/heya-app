      <h2>Introducing Heya ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>Heya ðŸ‘‹ is a campaign mailer for Rails. Think of it like ActionMailer, but for timed email sequences. It can also perform other actions like sending a text message. Generate and send automated email campaigns with just a few <code>rails</code> commands.</p>

      <p>We built Heya for our internal use at Honeybadger, and we thought you might like it too. We're not ashamed to say that we're in this to make money, though.
