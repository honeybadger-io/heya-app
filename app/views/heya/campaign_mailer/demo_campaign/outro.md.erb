Whew<%= @user.first_name.present? ? ", #{@user.first_name}" : nil %>, we made it!

If you made it this far, then you probably know what you're going to do next.

Is Heya right for you? If so, can you do me three favors?

1. Star it on GitHub: https://github.com/honeybadger-io/heya
2. Tell your friends and colleagues about it, tweet about it, etc. The more interest there is in it, the more time I can justify putting into making it better.
3. Use it in your Rails apps!

If not, no worries; it's not for everyone. Speaking of, if you would rather not get further emails about Heya, click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of this email before you go. I may send an occasional followup to those who wish to remain on this list.

Thanks<%= @user.first_name.present? ? " #{@user.first_name}" : nil %>!!
