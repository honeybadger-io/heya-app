Hi <%= @user.first_name.presence || "there" %>,

Heya is just a Ruby gem. Once installed in your Rails app, you can send email campaigns to your users in a way that is very similar to how you already deliver one-off emails with ActionMailer.

To send an email with Intercom, you would need to install the intercom-rails gem, define custom user properties to send, and then sync all of your users. When you need some *new* properties in Intercom, you get to do this all over again. Oh yeah, and you'll maintain the integration... forever.

**The best part about Heya is how easy it is to automate.**

Sending a campaign in systems like Intercom involves setting up complicated rules based on changing user properties and custom events. Sending a campaign in Heya is done right from your Rails app, using the logic you've already built (and tested) on your `User` model.

In the next email, Iâ€™ll show you a few other cool things that you can do with Heya that you can't with Intercom and friends.
